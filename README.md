# link-a-thon

Welcome to the link-a-thon (our very own project) - a.k.a. uController.

The goals of this project are to explore building linker-friendly web frameworks and learn something about:
- Optimizing for memory consumption
- Optimizing for size (of published app)
- Optimizing for startup time
- Using code-generation to make frameworks more static
- Using linker extensibility to recognize patterns
